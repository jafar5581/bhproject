            </div>

            <p className="text-[8px] md:text-[10px]  text-gray-500 py-3">We make our best efforts to ship each item in your order within 7 working days of the order confirmation date. However in some cases, we may take longer, up to 21 working days, to ship the order as we may have to procure it from some other stores or warehouse. In the unlikely event that we are not able to ship your order completely within the stipulated time, we shall inform you about the same. During sale and peak periods, orders may take longer to process. Our delivery times should only be used as a guide.</p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-[10px] md:text-[12px] py1">RULES & RESTRICTIONS</h3>

            <p className="text-[8px] md:text-[10px]  text-gray-500 py-3">Orders are processed and delivered on business days only. Business days are Monday to Saturday, excluding public holidays. Customers will be required to sign in for all deliveries. Due to logistical difficulties in making deliveries to certain remote areas, we reserve our right to cancel your order and/or make such order subject to additional terms and conditions (including, without limitation to, requiring such orders to be conditional upon a minimum value of products being ordered in a single transaction). Our Customer Care team will notify you of cancellation and/or such conditions after you place your order.</p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-[10px] md:text-[12px] py1">DELIVERY PROBLEMS</h3>

            <p className="text-[8px] md:text-[10px]  text-gray-500 py-3">If our shipping provider cannot make delivery to you at the provided shipping address, an additional attempt will be made the following business day. In case of a second failure to deliver, the parcel will be sent back and a refund will be initiated for all pre-paid orders. If your parcel has been sent back, please contact our Customer Care team for assistance.</p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-[10px] md:text-[12px] py1">ORDER PROCESSING TIME</h3>

            <p className="text-[8px] md:text-[10px]  text-gray-500 py-3">Most orders begin processing as soon as your online purchase is completed. Your order will be shipped once the items are located in stock. As soon as your order is shipped, you will be notified by email. Orders are typically dispatched within 24 - 48 hours on business days. Please note that business days are Monday to Saturday, excluding public holidays. Refer to Shipping Service & Costs for a guide on delivery times.</p>
